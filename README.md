The analysis of a selected data showed us that there are:

- 47 Vine reviews and 8362 non-Vine reviews. 

- 15 of Vine reviews were 5 stars and 4332 of non-Vine reviews were 5 stars.

- 32 % of all Vine reviews were 5 stars and 52% of non-Vine reviews were 5 stars.

 
Summary:

In this particur case having a paid Vine review didn't really make a difference in the percentage of 5-star reviews. The Vine program didn't incentivize positive coverage. Also, to note that there weren't too many paid reviews.

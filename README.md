![](Summary.png)

The analysis of a given data showed us that there are

    47 Vine reviews and 8362 non-Vine reviews. 

    15 Vine reviews were 5 stars and 4332 non-Vine reviews were 5 stars.

    32 % of Vine reviews were 5 stars when 52% of non-Vine reviews were 5 stars.

 
Summary:

In this particur case having a paid Vine review doesn't really make a difference in the percentage of 5-star reviews. The Vine program does not incentivize positive coverage.
